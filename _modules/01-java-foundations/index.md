## Module 1: Java Foundations (An In-Depth Look)

Welcome to the foundational module of the course. The goal here is to rewire your brain from the dynamically-typed, single-threaded world of Node.js to Java's statically-typed, multi-threaded environment. We will cover the core language features, the ecosystem, and the modern practices that make Java a powerful choice for backend development.

### Lessons in this Module

- **[Lesson 1.1: Java Basics - Types, Variables & Syntax]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/01-basics.md %})** - Master Java's type system, variables, and fundamental syntax differences from JavaScript
- **[Lesson 1.2: Control Flow & Arrays]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/02-control-flow-arrays.md %})** - Conditional statements, loops, and Java's fixed-size array system
- **[Lesson 1.3: Methods, Scope & Recursion]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/03-methods-scope.md %})** - Static vs instance methods, method overloading, variable scope, and recursive programming
- **[Lesson 1.4: Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/04-oop-fundamentals.md %})** - Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and the four pillars of OOP
- **[Lesson 1.5: Java Ecosystem & Environment]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/05-java-ecosystem.md %})** - JVM architecture, build tools (Maven/Gradle), IDEs, and deployment strategies
- **[Lesson 1.6: Data Structures & Collections]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/06-data-structures.md %})** - Master Java's Collections Framework: Lists, Sets, Maps, Queues, and their performance characteristics
- **[Lesson 1.7: File Handling & I/O]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/07-file-handling.md %})** - Modern file operations, streams, serialization, and advanced I/O techniques
- **[Lesson 1.8: Advanced Java Features]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/08-advanced-features.md %})** - Wrapper classes, generics, annotations, lambdas, Optional, and modern Java (records, sealed classes)

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- **Understand Java's Type System**: Master static typing, primitives vs objects, and type safety
- **Write Object-Oriented Code**: Apply encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction effectively
- **Navigate the Java Ecosystem**: Use build tools, IDEs, and understand JVM architecture
- **Handle Data Efficiently**: Choose appropriate collections and understand performance implications
- **Manage I/O Operations**: Read/write files safely and efficiently using modern Java APIs
- **Apply Advanced Features**: Use generics for type safety, lambdas for functional programming, and Optional for null safety
- **Follow Best Practices**: Write maintainable, performant Java code following enterprise standards

### Key Mindset Shifts from JavaScript/TypeScript

1. **Compile-Time Safety**: Catch errors at compilation, not runtime
2. **Explicit Types**: Everything has a declared type - no `any` or gradual typing
3. **Memory Management**: Understand stack vs heap, though GC handles cleanup
4. **Object-Oriented Design**: Everything lives in classes, strong encapsulation
5. **Performance Considerations**: Understand the cost of operations and choose appropriate data structures
6. **Enterprise Patterns**: Code for maintainability, scalability, and team collaboration

This comprehensive foundation will prepare you for enterprise Java development with Spring Framework and beyond!
