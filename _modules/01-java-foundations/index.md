## Module 1: Java Foundations (An In-Depth Look)

Welcome to the foundational module of the course. The goal here is to rewire your brain from the dynamically-typed, single-threaded world of Node.js to Java's statically-typed, multi-threaded environment. We will cover the core language features, the ecosystem, and the modern practices that make Java a powerful choice for backend development.

### Lessons in this Module

- **[Lesson 1.1: The Language]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/01-the-language.md %})** - A deep dive into syntax, the static type system, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, all compared directly to TypeScript.
- **[Lesson 1.2: The Ecosystem]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/02-the-ecosystem.md %})** - Understanding the JVM vs. the Node.js Event Loop, the JDK, and build tools (Maven/Gradle vs. npm/yarn).
- **[Lesson 1.3: The Collections Framework]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/03-collections-framework.md %})** - Mastering the core data structures in Java: `List`, `Set`, and `Map`.
- **[Lesson 1.4: Concurrency Basics]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/04-concurrency-basics.md %})** - An introduction to Threads, a critical and often difficult concept for developers coming from a single-threaded background.
- **[Lesson 1.5: Modern Java]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/05-modern-java.md %})** - Exploring modern features like the Streams API, `Optional`, and Records, which connect Java to functional patterns you may be familiar with.
