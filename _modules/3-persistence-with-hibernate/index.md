## Module 3: Persistence with Hibernate & Spring Data JPA

A backend application is incomplete without a database. This module introduces the data layer, focusing on how Java interacts with databases in a robust, type-safe way using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). We will explore Hibernate and the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification, comparing them to familiar tools like Prisma or Sequelize.
