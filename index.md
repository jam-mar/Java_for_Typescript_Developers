Welcome to the comprehensive migration guide for JavaScript and TypeScript developers moving to Java and the Spring ecosystem!

## Course Overview

This course is designed to help web developers transition smoothly from JavaScript/TypeScript to Java enterprise development. Whether you're looking to work in enterprise environments, build robust web APIs, or explore modern JVM-based development, this guide will help you make the leap.

### What You'll Learn

- **Fundamental differences** between JS/TS and Java development approaches
- **Java syntax and language features** through familiar JavaScript/TypeScript comparisons
- **Object-oriented programming** in Java with practical examples
- **JVM ecosystem and tooling** for modern development
- **Stream API and functional programming** - leverage your functional programming knowledge
- **Spring Framework and Spring Boot** for building web APIs and applications

## Getting Started

Ready to begin your Java journey? Start with our comprehensive foundation module:

**[Module 1: Foundations â€“ From the Node.js Event Loop to the JVM]({{ 'chapters/01-foundations/' | relative_url }})**

This foundational module includes everything you need to understand about transitioning from Node.js/TypeScript to Java enterprise development.

### Course Structure

- **[Module 1: Foundations â€“ From the Node.js Event Loop to the JVM]({{ 'chapters/01-foundations/' | relative_url }})** - Java language fundamentals, JVM understanding, build tools, and development environment setup _(Coming Soon)_
- **[Module 2: Spring Framework Fundamentals]({{ 'chapters/02-spring-fundamentals/' | relative_url }})** - Dependency injection, application bootstrapping, REST controllers, and configuration management _(Coming Soon)_

#### Module 1: Foundations

- **[Lesson 1.1: The Java Language: A TypeScript Developer's Guide]({{ '/lessons/01-01-java-language-guide/' | relative_url }})** - Java syntax and OOP through TypeScript comparisons _(Coming Soon)_
- **[Lesson 1.2: Understanding the JVM, JDK, and Runtime]({{ '/lessons/01-02-jvm-jdk-runtime/' | relative_url }})** - JVM architecture vs. Node.js runtime _(Coming Soon)_
- **[Lesson 1.3: Build Tools & Dependency Management]({{ '/lessons/01-03-build-tools-dependencies/' | relative_url }})** - Maven vs. Gradle (and npm/yarn) _(Coming Soon)_
- **[Lesson 1.4: Setting Up Your Development Environment]({{ '/lessons/01-04-intellij-setup/' | relative_url }})** - Professional Java development with IntelliJ IDEA _(Coming Soon)_

#### Module 2: Spring Framework Fundamentals

- **[Lesson 2.2: Bootstrapping with Spring Initializr]({{ '/lessons/02-02-spring-initializr/' | relative_url }})** - Creating your first Spring Boot application _(Coming Soon)_
- **[Lesson 2.3: Creating REST Controllers]({{ '/lessons/02-03-rest-controllers/' | relative_url }})** - Building REST APIs with Spring MVC vs. Express.js _(Coming Soon)_
- **[Lesson 2.4: Configuration and Environment Profiles]({{ '/lessons/02-04-configuration-profiles/' | relative_url }})** - Managing application configuration across environments _(Coming Soon)_

### What Makes This Course Different

- **Built for Node.js/TypeScript developers** - Every concept explained through familiar comparisons
- **Enterprise-focused** - Learn the tools and patterns used in real enterprise environments
- **Hands-on project integration** - Practical examples with a companion project repository

## Companion Project

This course is paired with a hands-on **Enterprise Task Management System** built with Java and Spring Boot. Follow along as we implement each concept in a real-world application.
