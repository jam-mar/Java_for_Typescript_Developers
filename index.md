Welcome to the comprehensive migration guide for JavaScript and TypeScript developers moving to Java and the Spring ecosystem!

## Course Overview

This course is designed to help web developers transition smoothly from JavaScript/TypeScript to Java enterprise development. Whether you're looking to work in enterprise environments, build robust web APIs, or explore modern JVM-based development, this guide will help you make the leap.

### What You'll Learn

- **Java language features** and the core differences from JS/TS.
- The **JVM ecosystem**, concurrency model, and modern tooling.
- Building robust Web APIs with **Spring Boot**.
- Data persistence with **Hibernate** and **Spring Data JPA**.
- Database version control with **Flyway**.
- **Testing, security, and containerization** for production-ready applications.

### Course Structure

- **[Module 1: Java Foundations]({% link _modules/01-java-foundations/index.md %})** - Rewire your brain from the dynamically-typed, single-threaded world of Node.js to Java's statically-typed, multi-threaded environment.

- **[Module 2: Building Web APIs with Spring Boot]({% link _modules/02-building-web-apis/index.md %})** - Focus on the web layer, directly comparing it to common Node.js frameworks like Express.js.

- **[Module 3: Persistence with Hibernate & Spring Data JPA]({% link _modules/03-persistence-with-hibernate/index.md %})** - Introduce the data layer and ORM to interact with a database in a robust, type-safe way.

- **[Module 4: Database Management with Flyway]({% link _modules/04-database-management-with-flyway/index.md %})** - Learn the critical concept of database migrations for version-controlling your database schema.

- **[Module 5: Advanced Topics & Production Readiness]({% link _modules/05-advanced-topics/index.md %})** - Cover essential skills for building real-world, enterprise-grade applications, including testing, security, and containerization.

### What Makes This Course Different

- **Built for Node.js/TypeScript developers** - Every concept explained through familiar comparisons.
- **Enterprise-focused** - Learn the tools and patterns used in real enterprise environments.
- **Hands-on project integration** - Practical examples with a companion project repository.

## Companion Project

This course is paired with a hands-on **Enterprise Task Management System** built with Java and Spring Boot. Follow along as we implement each concept in a real-world application.
