Welcome to the comprehensive migration guide for JavaScript and TypeScript developers moving to Java and the Spring ecosystem!

## Course Overview

This course is designed to help web developers transition smoothly from JavaScript/TypeScript to Java enterprise development. Whether you're looking to work in enterprise environments, build robust web APIs, or explore modern JVM-based development, this guide will help you make the leap.

### What You'll Learn

- **Fundamental differences** between JS/TS and Java development approaches
- **Java syntax and language features** through familiar JavaScript/TypeScript comparisons
- **Object-oriented programming** in Java with practical examples
- **JVM ecosystem and tooling** for modern development
- **Stream API and functional programming** - leverage your functional programming knowledge
- **Spring Framework and Spring Boot** for building web APIs and applications

## Getting Started

Ready to begin your Java journey? Start with our comprehensive foundation module:

**[Module 1: Foundations â€“ From the Node.js Event Loop to the JVM]({% link _modules/01-foundations/index.md %})**

This foundational module includes everything you need to understand about transitioning from Node.js/TypeScript to Java enterprise development.

### Course Structure
